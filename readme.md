Combining an API with web scraping allows you to gather rich, multi-source data.

Here's a complete project outline that uses Spotify's API and scrapes data from the Billboard Hot 100 chart. This is perfect because you can analyze what's trending globally (via Spotify) vs. what's historically popular in a specific country (the US, via Billboard).

Project Title: "Global Pulse vs. Local Charts: A Music Trend Analyzer"
Concept: Compare current global streaming trends from Spotify with the most popular songs in a specific country (the US, using Billboard) to find overlaps, discrepancies, and interesting insights.

1. The API: Spotify Web API
Spotify's API is excellent for this. It provides a wealth of data about songs, artists, albums, and audio features.

What you'll get from the API:

Top Tracks: Retrieve the current top songs globally or by country.

Audio Features: Get quantitative data about each track (danceability, energy, valence (happiness), tempo, etc.). This is gold for visualization.

Artist Genres: Get the genres associated with the artists.

Key Endpoints:

https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/tracks (For a user's top tracks, requires authentication)

https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/{{playlist_id}} (To get tracks from a curated playlist, like "Top 50 Global")

https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-features/{{track_id}} (To get audio features for a specific track)

https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/{{artist_id}} (To get genre info)

Authentication: You'll need to create a free app on the Spotify Developer Dashboard to get a CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET. The most straightforward method for a script is the Client CredentialsÂ Flow.
